                  <h3>Measuring ingredients:</h3>
                  <p>When measuring dry ingredients, such as flour or powdered 
                      sugar, spoon the ingredient into the measuring cup. This 
                      helps prevent packing the ingredients, which will offput 
                      the ratio in the recipe.</p>

                  <h3>Sifting:</h3>
                    <p>Sifting dry ingredients is ideal to get a good mixture 
                      when making cakes and other batters. It helps eliminate 
                      any lumps and will also make sure that each ingredient 
                      is evenly distributed throughout the batter.
                    </p>
                    <p>You will absolutely need to sift powdered sugar when making 
                    frostings. It is best to sift the sugar right into the 
                    buttercream as you are making this. This will prevent 
                    lumpy frosting from forming.

                  <h3>Beating Eggs / Egg whites:</h3>
                  <p>It is best to have room temperature eggs when a recipe 
                      calls for beaten eggs or whisked egg whites, especially 
                      for recipes such as angel food cake and meringue. 
                      Allowing the eggs to come to room temperature allows 
                      the eggs to whip up in a greater volume.
                  </p>
                  <p>It is also important not to over-beat the batter once 
                     the eggs have been added. Over-beating will cause the 
                     cake to come out rubbery.

                  <h3>Butter:</h3>
                    <p>Unless the recipe tells you to melt the butter, DO NOT 
                        melt it. Instead, leave the butter out at room temperature 
                        for at least one hour prior to making the recipe. This is 
                        crucial when making butter cream, as it will whip up much 
                        better and will give you a nice smooth and light frosting.

                  <h3>Fold vs Whisk vs Stir vs Beat:</h3>
                    <p>Language is important when it comes to recipes, and there 
                        is a difference between “beating” something in and “stirring” it in.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Folding</strong> is done by using a spatula and gently ‘folding’ the 
                        two mixtures together. This is usually called for when mixing 
                        meringue into a batter. This is so air beaten into the meringue 
                        is not lost with vigorous stirring.
                    </p><strong>Whisking</strong> is done using a hand whisk or a whisk attachment. 
                        This is done to try to incorporate air into whatever is being whisked. 
                        This is crucial for meringue and some cake recipes.
                    </p><strong>Stirring</strong> is done by simply mixing in the ingredient either slowly 
                        by hand or on a slow/low setting on a stand mixer. I would not 
                        recommend using an electric hand mixer for this as the lowest 
                        settings are usually still too fast.
                    </p><strong>Beating</strong> is usually done by using an electric hand mixer or a stand mixer on a 
                        medium to high setting (the recipe should tell you what speed, and if it doesn’t, 
                        stick with medium to medium-low). This is usually done to incorporate ingredients 
                        well together, such as when combining dry and wet ingredients, with cakes, or when softening
                        butter for buttercream frosting.

                  <h3>Preparing Pans:</h3>
                  <p>I will always recommend using parchment paper when baking. It will save so 
                      much time and keep your cakes and other baked goods looking great.
                  </p>
                  <p>To use parchment paper, grease the pans with butter, margarine, or shortening (I recommend 
                      shortening as its cheaper and lasts longer than butter). Cut out a piece of parchment 
                      paper that will fit on the bottom of the pan and then place it in the greased pan. 
                      The grease should help the parchment paper stick. Then use flour to coat the edges 
                      of the pan. If the pan is deep, I would recommend using parchment paper to line the 
                      sides instead of flour.

                  <h3>Decorating:</h3>
                    <p>Always let baked goods cool before adding any kind of decoration. If you 
                        try to decorate something that is still even slightly warm, the decoration will 
                        likely melt. Always make sure it is completely cool before decorating.

                  <h3>Cooling Cakes:</h3>
                    <p>Cool cakes and other baked goods on a wire rack on the counter. Do not 
                        place hot cakes or other baked goods in the fridge or freezer to cool 
                        faster. This will cause condensation to build on your fresh baked 
                        goodness and will cause to get soggy.
